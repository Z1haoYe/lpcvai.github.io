                          involves many
                          tasks. This challenge focuses on object detection, a
                          basic
                          routine in many recognition approaches. The following
                          two
                          examples illustrate the task. In the first example,
                          there are
                          two objects: a bird and a frog. In the second example,
                          there
                          are several objects: cars, persons, motorcycle, and a
                          helmet.

                          different.
                          &nbsp;The images are divided into small groups.
                          &nbsp;The
                          order of images inside each group may be
                          different.<br><br>Q:
                          If the image orders are different, would that be fair?
                          &nbsp;Would some images be harder than the
                          others?<br>A: The
                          group sizes are small. &nbsp;If a team process many
                          groups,
                          the differences should be negligible.<br><br>Q: Why
                          are the
                          image orders different for different teams?<br>A: Some
                          teams
                          have multiple solutions. &nbsp;If the image orders are
                          the
                          same, one of these teams might use the images from the
                          first
                          solution, perform off-line processing, and obtain
                          advantage in
                          the second time. This would be unfair. If the orders
                          are
                          different, it would be more difficult to perform
                          off-line
                          processing and this will improve fairness.<br><br>Q:
                          What is
                          the group size?<br>A: The group sizes will not be
                          announced.
                          In fact, the groups may have different sizes.
                          &nbsp;<br><br>Q:
                          How much time do I have for setup?<br>A: We expect
                          that 10
                          minutes should be sufficient. Thus, each team (or each
                          solution of a team that has multiple solutions) should
                          take
                          approximately 20 minutes total.<br><br>Q: How is the
                          team
                          order determined?<br>A: The team order will be
                          determined by
                          drawing lottery before the challenge starts. There
                          will be two
                          rounds of lottery. The first round determines the
                          order of the
                          second round. The second round determines the order of
                          the
                          challenge.<br><br>Q: Do I have to stay when the other
                          teams
                          are running?<br>A: You are free to leave anytime. If
                          it is
                          your turn and you are absent, the next team will
                          start. When
                          you come back, you will be the one after the current
                          team.<br><br>Q: When will the entire challenge
                          finish?<br>A:
                          It is hard to predict since the setup time may
                          vary.<br><br>Q:
                          If I am late, what happens?<br>A: If you do not show
                          up when
                          all the other teams have finished, you are
                          disqualified.<br><br>Q: Will we know which team is
                          running?<br>A: Yes. A sign will be posted showing the
                          currently running team.<br><br>Q: When will power
                          measurement
                          stop?<br>A: Ten minutes after your system logs
                          in.<br><br>Q:
                          Should my system send all answers to the referee at
                          once, or
                          one at a time?<br>A: You decide.<br><br>It is advised
                          that
                          your system sends answers to the referee often.
                          &nbsp;The
                          referee program will refuse to communicate with your
                          system
                          ten minutes after your system logs in. If your system
                          sends
                          all answers at once near the end of the ten minutes,
                          it is
                          possible that your system does not finish sending all
                          results
                          within the ten minutes.<br><br>Q: Is the ten-minute
                          rule
                          enforced by hand (using a stopwatch)?<br>A: This rule
                          is
                          enforced by the referee program.<br><br>Q: My team has
                          several
                          solutions. Can we try all of them and use the highest
                          score?<br>A: For fairness, each registration allows
                          only one
                          solution. &nbsp;If your team has multiple solutions,
                          please
                          have one registration for each solution.<br><br>Q: Are
                          there
                          only 5,000 images? What happens if we finish 5,000
                          images
                          within 10 minutes?<br>A: You can shut down the system
                          to
                          reduce the energy consumption. &nbsp;Alternatively,
                          your
                          system may log out and this will stop the power meter.
                          We
                          encourage you to do both (shutdown and log
                          out).<br><br>Q: Do
                          I have to disassemble the system?<br>A: You need to
                          provide a
                          way to measure the power.<br><br>Q: I do not want to
                          break my
                          system.<br>A: We can measure the power consumed by a
                          power
                          adapter that charges your system. Please be aware that
                          the
                          power adapter consumes additional power.<br><br>Q:
                          What is the
                          maximum current my system can draw?<br>A: The power
                          meter's
                          upper limit is 20A. For DC (up to 32V), a fuse of 15A
                          is used.
                          For AC (up to 250V), a fuse of 2A is used.
                          &nbsp;<br><br>Q:
                          Does the power meter supply power?<br>A: No.<br><br>Q:
                          When
                          will we get the username and password?<br>A: At least
                          12 hours
                          before the challenge starts.<br><br>Q: When will the
                          network
                          router's username and password be given?<br>A: At
                          least 12
                          hours before the challenge starts.<br><br>Q: Can my
                          system
                          communicate with the referee program when another team
                          is
                          running?<br>A: No. The network router allows only the
                          running
                          team.<br><br>Q: Do you provide a power supply?<br>A:
                          No.<br><br>Q: How will the travel grants be
                          determined?<br>A:
                          It depends on the number of participants. If there is
                          enough
                          fund, every participant will receive a travel grant.
                          If the
                          fund is insufficient, <strong>earlier registrations
                            will have
                            higher priority.</strong><br><br>Q: Can an observer
                          (without
                          paying the $180 registration fee) receive a travel
                          grant?<br>A: Due to the limited fund, only the people
                          that
                          register and pay $180 are eligible for the travel
                          grants.&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong><br><br>Q: If I
                          register
                          and pay $180 but cannot attend on June 7, can I get
                          refund?<br>A: Please contact the conference.<br><br>Q:
                          Can I
                          bring special hardware?<br>A: Yes.<br><br>Q: Can I use
                          commodity hardware (such as mobile phone, laptop, or
                          desktop)?<br>A: Yes.<br><br>Q: Can I combine special
                          hardware
                          and commodity hardware?<br>A: Yes.<br><br>Q: Are
                          companies
                          allow to compete?<br>A: Yes, of course.<br><br>Q: Are
                          participants outside USA allowed?<br>A: Yes, of
                          course.<br><br>Q: The interface program is written in
                          Python.
                          Does my program have to use Python?<br>A: You can use
                          any
                          language, as long as it communicates with the referee
                          program
                          using HTTP.<br><br>Q: I want to spend a lot of money
                          to build
                          the best system and win. Is there any restriction on
                          how much
                          I can be spend?&nbsp; <br>A: Yes, you can spend as
                          much money
                          as you prefer. <br><br>Q: Must the system use DC power
                          from
                          batteries?<br>A: There is no such restriction. Your
                          system may
                          draw AC power from a wall socket.<br><br>Q: Is it
                          possible
                          that an&nbsp; image contain multiple objects?<br>A:
                          Yes, that
                          is possible<br><br>Q: Can I see without

                          support?<br>A:
                          Yes, travel grants are available. Please visit the
                          conference
                          web site (www.dac.com) for application.<br><br>Q: How
                          does my
                          program communicate with the system?<br>A: A program
                          template
                          will be available for the interface. The interface
                          will be
                          HTTP based. There will be a wireless/wired
                          router.<br><br>Q:
                          How should I write my program so that it can
                          communicate with
                          your program?<br>A: Please structure your program so
                          that it
                          has two components: the recognition engine and the
                          interface.
                          The interface will be released before the
                          competition.<br><br>Q: How can my computer connect to
                          yours,
                          get data, and send results?<br>A: An intranet will be
                          set up.
                          Both wired (RJ 45) and wireless (Wifi) will be
                          available.&nbsp;<br><br>Q: How do I know which Wifi
                          network to
                          connect to?<br>A: It will be announced before the
                          competition.
                          To prevent&nbsp;interference, the Wifi for this
                          competition
                          will make the SSID invisible and a password is
                          needed.&nbsp;<br><br>Q: Can my computer connect to the
                          Internet?<br>A: Yes. The San Francisco Convention
                          Center has
                          wireless network. Please be aware that your system
                          needs to
                          connect to an intranet to get the images and to send
                          the
                          results. If your system also needs access to the
                          Internet, you
                          will need a way (possibly two network interfaces) to
                          connect
                          to it.<br><br>Q: May I bring a "server" and offload
                          computation to that server using the intranet?<br>A:
                          Yes. Your
                          server can connect to router provided by the

                          TETC?<br>A: No.
                          These are two different events. You may compete in
                          June
                          without submitting a paper to TETC. You may submit a

                          first
                          competition of its kind?<br>A: We believe so, even
                          though
                          there have been related competitions. For

                          concerns about
                          only accuracy, not energy. The design contest at
                          ISLPED does
                          not focus on image recognition.<br><br>Q: My team has
                          several
                          people. Does everyone need to register?<br>A: Yes.
                          Please.<br><br>Q: Do I need to register the whole
                          conference.<br>A: It is not necessary to register the
                          entire
                          conference.<br><br>Q: When will registration
                          start?<br>A:
                          March 31, 2015.<br><br>Q: Do I have to register in
                          advance?&nbsp;<br>A: "Walk-in" would not be ideal
                          since we
                          need to distribute user names and passwords. Please
                          register
                          early.<br><br>Q: How many test images are there?<br>A:
                          There
                          will be around 5000 test images. &nbsp;It is not
                          expected that
                          entries doing on-device processing will complete most
                          of the
                          images.<br><br>Q: Does the accuracy criteria reward
                          processing
                          more images? &nbsp;Would I do better by processing
                          just one
                          easy image and stopping to save energy?<br>A: The
                          average
                          precision measure is computed by averaging precision
                          over the
                          amount of recall, so the more correct detections a
                          system
                          produces, the higher the accuracy score will
                          be.<br><br>Q:
                          Will there be any presentation on June 7, 2015?<br>A:
                          There
                          will be opening remarks by the organizers. There is no
                          presentation during the competition.<br><br>Q: Do I
                          have to
                          stay for the entire duration of the competition?<br>A:
                          You can
                          come and go as your schedule permits.<br><br>Q: Will
                          you tell
                          me the time of my turn?<br>A: Yes. We will inform the
                          teams of
                          the assigned time based on the
                          registrations.<br><br>Q: My
                          team has several solutions with different strengths in
                          energy
                          efficiency and recognition accuracy. Can one team have
                          multiple entries?<br>A: Yes. Each registration allows
                          one
                          solution. If your team has two registrations, both
                          solutions
                          can be tested.</div>
