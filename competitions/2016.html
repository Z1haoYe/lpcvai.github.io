                        autonomous

                        recognition involves many tasks. This challenge focuses
                        on
                        object detection, a basic routine in many recognition
                        approaches. The following two examples illustrate the
                        task. In
                        the first example, there are two objects: a bird and a
                        frog. In
                        the second example, there are several objects: cars,
                        persons,
                        motorcycle, and a helmet. The training and validation

                          Questions):</strong><br><br>Q: How will be energy be
                        measured?<br>A: Please see the photographs above.<br>If
                        your
                        system is connected to 110V AC (standard wall socket in
                        USA),
                        the system will be plugged into a specially made
                        socket.<br>We
                        have universal connectors &nbsp;taking two wires from
                        your power
                        source (such as a battery) and providing two wires out
                        to your
                        system.<br><br>Q: When will the travel grants be
                        given?<br>A: At
                        the beginning of the challenge (around 850-910AM) on
                        June 5,
                        2016.<br><br>Q: On June 5, do I have a chance testing
                        whether my
                        system can communicate with the referee?<br>A: Yes.
                        Before the
                        challenge starts, all teams can test whether their
                        systems can
                        communicate with the referee.&nbsp;<br><br>Q: May I test
                        my
                        system during the challenge, while another team is
                        running?<br>A: No. During the challenge, only the
                        competing
                        teams' systems can communicate with the referee.
                        &nbsp;This is
                        to prevent interference.<br><br>Q: Do I have another
                        chance
                        testing the communication before the ten minutes
                        start?<br>A:
                        Yes. Your system can send a request to retrieve the
                        document
                        (/help in the URL).<br><br>Q: When does power
                        measurement
                        start?<br>A: When your system logs in. &nbsp;It is
                        advised that
                        your system starts requesting images as soon as the
                        system logs
                        in.<br><br>Q: Will all teams receive the same
                        images?<br>A: Yes,
                        but the orders may be different. The images are divided
                        into
                        small groups. The order of images inside each group may
                        be
                        different.<br><br>Q: If the image orders are different,
                        would
                        that be fair? &nbsp;Would some images be harder than the
                        others?<br>A: The group sizes are small. &nbsp;If a team
                        processes many groups, the differences should be
                        negligible.<br><br>Q: Why are the image orders different
                        for
                        different teams?<br>A: Some teams have multiple
                        solutions.
                        &nbsp;If the image orders are the same, one of these
                        teams might
                        use the images from the first solution, perform off-line
                        processing, and obtain advantage in the second time.
                        This would
                        be unfair. If the orders are different, it would be more
                        difficult to perform off-line processing and this will
                        improve
                        fairness.<br><br>Q: What is the group size?<br>A: The
                        group
                        sizes will not be announced. In fact, the groups may
                        have
                        different sizes. &nbsp;<br><br>Q: How much time do I
                        have for
                        setup?<br>A: We expect that 10 minutes should be
                        sufficient.
                        Thus, each team (or each solution of a team that has
                        multiple
                        solutions) should take approximately 20 minutes
                        total.<br><br>Q:
                        How is the team order determined?<br>A: The team order
                        will be
                        determined by drawing lottery before the challenge
                        starts. There
                        will be two rounds of lottery. The first round
                        determines the
                        order of the second round. The second round determines
                        the order
                        of the challenge.<br><br>Q: Do I have to stay when the
                        other
                        teams are running?<br>A: You are free to leave anytime.
                        If it is
                        your turn and you are absent, <strong>you lose that
                          round</strong>.<br><br>Q: When will the entire
                        challenge
                        finish?<br>A: It is hard to predict since the setup time
                        may
                        vary.<br><br>Q: Will we know which team is
                        running?<br>A: Yes. A
                        sign will be posted showing the currently running
                        team.<br><br>Q: When will power measurement stop?<br>A:
                        Ten
                        minutes after your system logs in.<br><br>Q: Should my
                        system
                        send all answers to the referee at once, or one at a
                        time?<br>A:
                        You decide.<br><br>It is advised that your system sends
                        answers
                        to the referee <strong>often</strong>. &nbsp;The referee
                        program
                        will refuse to communicate with your system ten minutes
                        after
                        your system logs in. If your system sends all answers at
                        once
                        near the end of the ten minutes, it is possible that
                        your system
                        does not finish sending all results within the ten
                        minutes.<br><br>Q: Is the ten-minute rule enforced by
                        hand
                        (using a stopwatch)?<br>A: This rule is enforced by the
                        referee
                        program.<br><br>Q: My team has several solutions. Can we
                        try all
                        of them and use the highest score?<br>A: For fairness,
                        each
                        registration allows only one solution. &nbsp;If your
                        team has
                        multiple solutions, please have one registration for
                        each
                        solution.<br><br>Q: Are there only 5,000 images? What
                        happens if
                        we finish 5,000 images within 10 minutes?<br>A: You can
                        shut
                        down the system to reduce the energy consumption.
                        &nbsp;Alternatively, your system may log out and this
                        will stop
                        the power meter. We encourage you to do both (shutdown
                        and log
                        out).<br><br>Q: Do I have to disassemble the system so
                        that you
                        can measure power?<br>A: You need to provide a way to
                        measure
                        the power.<br><br>Q: I do not want to break my
                        system.<br>A: We
                        can measure the power consumed by a power adapter that
                        charges
                        your system. Please be aware that the power adapter
                        consumes
                        additional power.<br><br>Q: What is the maximum current
                        my
                        system can draw?<br>A: The power meter's upper limit is
                        20A. For
                        DC (up to 32V), a fuse of 15A is used. For AC (up to
                        250V), a
                        fuse of 2A is used. &nbsp;<br><br>Q: Does the power
                        meter supply
                        power?<br>A: No.<br><br>Q: Does my system have to
                        communicate
                        with the referee system through HTTP?<br>A:
                        Yes.<br><br>Q: Can
                        my system communicate with the referee program when
                        another team
                        is running?<br>A: No. The network router allows only the
                        running
                        teams.<br><br>Q: Do you provide a power supply?<br>A:
                        No.<br><br>Q: How will the travel grants be
                        determined?<br>A: It
                        depends on the number of participants. If there is
                        enough fund,
                        every participant will receive a travel grant. If the
                        fund is
                        insufficient, <strong>earlier registrations will have
                          higher
                          priority.</strong><br><br>Q: Can an observer (without
                        paying
                        the registration fee) receive a travel grant?<br>A: Due
                        to the
                        limited fund, only the people that register and pay the
                        fee are
                        eligible for the travel
                        grants.&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong><br><br>Q: If I
                        register and
                        pay the fee but cannot attend on June 5, can I get
                        refund?<br>A:
                        Please contact the conference.<br><br>Q: Can I bring
                        special
                        hardware?<br>A: Yes.<br><br>Q: Can I use commodity
                        hardware
                        (such as mobile phone, laptop, or desktop)?<br>A:
                        Yes.<br><br>Q:
                        Can I combine special hardware and commodity
                        hardware?<br>A:
                        Yes.<br><br>Q: Are companies allow to compete?<br>A:
                        Yes, of
                        course.<br><br>Q: Are participants outside USA
                        allowed?<br>A:
                        Yes, of course.<br><br>Q: The interface program is
                        written in
                        Python. Does my program have to use Python?<br>A: You
                        can use
                        any language, as long as it communicates with the
                        referee
                        program using HTTP.<br><br>Q: I want to spend a lot of
                        money to
                        build the best system and win. Is there any restriction
                        on how
                        much I can be spend?&nbsp;<br>A: You can spend as much
                        money as
                        you prefer. <br><br>Q: Must the system use DC power from
                        batteries?<br>A: There is no such restriction. Your
                        system may
                        draw AC power from a wall socket.<br><br>Q: Is it
                        possible that
                        an&nbsp; image contain multiple objects?<br>A: Yes, that
                        is
                        possible<br><br>Q: Can I observe without
                        competing?<br>A:
                        Yes.&nbsp;<br><br>Q: Is there any financial
                        support?<br>A: Yes,
                        travel grants are available. Please visit the conference
                        web
                        site (www.dac.com) for application.<br><br>Q: How does
                        my
                        program communicate with the system?<br>A: A program
                        template
                        will be available for the interface. The interface will
                        be HTTP
                        based. There will be a wireless/wired router.<br><br>Q:
                        How
                        should I write my program so that it can communicate
                        with your
                        program?<br>A: Please structure your program so that it
                        has two
                        components: the recognition engine and the interface.
                        The
                        interface will be released before the
                        competition.<br><br>Q: How
                        can my computer connect to yours, get data, and send
                        results?<br>A: An intranet will be set up. Both wired
                        (RJ 45)
                        and wireless (Wifi) will be available. For track 3, the
                        images
                        are provided through a display (thus, you need to bring
                        a
                        camera). For all tracks, the answers are sent to the
                        referee
                        through the network.<br><br>Q: How do I know which Wifi
                        network
                        to connect to?<br>A: It will be announced before the
                        competition. To prevent&nbsp;interference, the Wifi for
                        this
                        competition will make the SSID invisible and a password
                        is
                        needed.&nbsp;<br><br>Q: Can my computer connect to the
                        Internet?<br>A: The referee system forms an intranet and
                        it does
                        not connect to the Internet. If your system also needs
                        access to
                        the Internet, you will need a way (possibly two network
                        interfaces) to connect to it.<br><br>Q: May I bring a
                        "server"
                        and offload computation to that server using the
                        intranet?<br>A:
                        Yes. Your server can connect to router provided by the
                        organizer. Please be aware that this is an intranet for
                        connecting to the referee computer and your own
                        server.&nbsp;<br><br>Q: How can my team be qualified for
                        Track 2
                        (offloading)?<br>A: You must have a front end and a back
                        end.
                        The front end communicates with the referee system. The
                        back end
                        does not communicate with the referee system. If your
                        system
                        does not have a back end, it is considered Track
                        1.<br><br>Q:
                        How can my front end communicate with the back
                        end?<br>A: You
                        can use the network router (wifi or RJ45) provided by
                        the
                        organizer.&nbsp;<br><br>Q: Do I need to register the
                        whole
                        conference.<br>A: It is not necessary to register the
                        entire
                        conference.<br><br>Q: Do I have to register this
                        challenge in
                        advance?&nbsp;<br>A: Yes. On-site registration is not
                        allowed.&nbsp;<br><br>Q: How many test images are
                        there?<br>A:
                        There will be around 5000 test images. &nbsp;It is not
                        expected
                        that entries doing on-device processing will complete
                        most of
                        the images.<br><br>Q: Does the accuracy criteria reward
                        processing more images? &nbsp;Would I do better by
                        processing
                        just one easy image and stopping to save energy?<br>A:
                        The
                        average precision measure is computed by averaging
                        precision
                        over the amount of recall, so the more correct
                        detections a
                        system produces, the higher the accuracy score will
                        be.<br><br>Q: Will there be any presentation on June 5,
                        2016?<br>A: There will be opening remarks by the
                        organizers.
                        There is no presentation during the
                        competition.<br><br>Q: Do I
                        have to stay for the entire duration of the
                        competition?<br>A:
                        You can come and go as your schedule permits.<br><br>Q:
                        My team
                        has several solutions with different strengths in energy
                        efficiency and recognition accuracy. Can one team have
                        multiple
                        entries?<br>A: Yes. Each registration allows one
                        solution. If
                        your team has K registrations, K solutions can be
                        tested.<br><br>Q: In Track 1 and Track 2, how many
                        rounds will
                        each time compete?<br>A:&nbsp;This depends on the number
                        of
                        teams. It is expected that there is enough time for each
                        team to
                        compete at least twice against two different
                        teams.<br><br>Q: Do
                        I have time fixing problems?<br>A: You can do anything
                        before
                        your turn. If it is your turn and you are not ready, you
                        lose
                        the round.<br><br><strong>The following Q/A is for Track
                          3.</strong><br><br>Q: What is the size of the
                        display?<br>A:
                        Dell U2414H is 24 inch and the resolution is 1920 x
                        1080.<br><br>Q: What are the sizes of the images?<br>A:
                        The
                        display will have black background with white square
                        markers on
                        the four corners. The size of the markers will be the
                        same for
                        all images.<br><br>Q: Do all images have the same
                        size?<br>A:
                        No. The images will be resized to fit in the rectangle
                        between
                        the markers. Resizing will keep the images' aspect
                        ratios.&nbsp;<br><br>Q: How do I know the ID of an
                        image?<br>A:
                        A 20-bit binary code will be used to show an image's ID.
                        Each
                        bit can be black or white. Black = 0. White =
                        1.<br><br>Q: How
                        is the binary code displayed on the screen?<br>A: The
                        binary
                        code will be at the left side (bits 10-19) and right
                        side (bits
                        0-9) of the image between the markers.&nbsp;The most
                        significant
                        bit (MSB) is at the upper left corner (below the upper
                        left
                        marker). The least significant bit is at the lower right
                        corner
                        (above the lower right marker).<br><br>Q: Do I have to
                        decide
                        the binary code to determine the images' IDs?<br>A:
                        Yes.<br><br>Q: What is the format of the answers to be
                        sent to
                        the referee system?<br>A: The same format as Tracks 1
                        and
                        2.<br><br>Q: Is offloading allowed in Track 3?<br>A:
                        Yes. Track
                        3 does not distinguish offloading or not. If you use
                        offloading,
                        only the front end's energy is
                        measured.<br><br><strong>Future

                          be
                          measured by a power meter. The meter can measure both
                          DC power
                          and AC power. These are several examples:</span>

                              connect
                              the tablet with the battery with external wires.
                              The power
                              meter can measure the voltage and the current from
                              the
                              battery to calculate the power
                              consumption.</span></li>
                          <li><span style="color: #2a2a2a;">A participant may
                              use a
                              smartphone without removing the battery. In this
                              case, the
                              power consumed by the (AC to DC) charger is
                              measured. This
                              requires no change to the

                              desktop that draws AC power. The power from the
                              socket is
                              measured. This requires no change to the

                          situation. Please be aware that the energy loss due to
                          voltage
                          conversion by the charger (or the power supply) is
                          added to
                          the total energy consumption and may reduce the
